Kernel Detective

Purchased from GamingMasteR many years ago.  As this code is quite old... I see zero reason not to make it public.

This is the driver part "Kernel Detective" the x86 Anti-Rootkit.

The GUI application may be found in Application.7z

Was lazy, and did the upload via the github website =p
